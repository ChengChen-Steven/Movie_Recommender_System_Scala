# Movie_Recommender_System_Scala

This is a course project which leveraged Spark to build a movie recommender system in Scala.

Two methods will be used:

1. Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm in spark.mllib; 
2. Item-based Collaborative Filtering from scratch; 

We will be discussing slightly about the speed and accuracy in this case.
